# Hafcons

This app shows the color codes for most of the brand icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=brands). You can click on the copy icon to grab the hex code more easily (this feature is a WIP).

All required data is fetched from `brands.json`, then each icon card is created dynamically with JavaScript.
